## Transcribing WAV files

This repository includes a sample script `transcribe.py` that uses the `speech_recognition` package to convert a WAV audio file to text. Install the dependency first:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
```

Then run:

```bash
python transcribe.py path/to/your_audio.wav
```

The script prints the recognized Japanese text to standard output.
